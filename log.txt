2015-03-09: Split off from larger local repo and pushed to github

  This Agda development was an attempt at understanding the Idris code
  in what later became https://github.com/nicolabotta/SeqDecProbs

2014-09-06: Installed new Agda: version 2.4.2

  cd ~/lib
  wget https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib/archive/v0.8.1.tar.gz
  tar -zxf v0.8.1.tar.gz
  rm agda-stdlib
  ln -s agda-stdlib-0.8.1/src agda-stdlib

  agda -i . -i /home/patrikj/lib/agda-stdlib Examples.agda
  -> loads fine, but lots of holes (metavariables) remain

2014-04-30: Looking at the Agda code again

  log.txt  -- this documentation file


  Blt.agda       -- Helper: bounded natural numbers (Fin)
  Prelude.agda

  Max.agda       -- parts of the assumptions would fit in here (not used by Context yet)
  Context.agda   -- records of assumptions for the main algorithm
  OptimalControls.agda  -- imports Context
  OptimalPolicies.agda  -- imports Context

  BackwardsInduction.agda -- Main file

  Examples.agda  -- Imports most of the other files
  
  Controls.agda  -- TODO - still Idris code (imports Context)

2013-11-04: Paper submitted [was later rejected]

  Dear Patrik Jansson,

2013-10-25: Three TODOs done - just OptLemma remaining

2013-10-25: remaining TODOs are
  Context.agda:
  * use the Max record in Context (not important) 
  BackwardsInduction.agda:
  * define OptLemma based on the time-independent case
  * optExtension: calculates an optimal Policy to extend a PolicySeq with. ***TODO: complete definition
  * OptExtensionLemma: proces that optExtension really does what it should. ***TODO: complete proof

  ----------------------------------------------------------------
  Discussion:
  * Differences in readability of definitions
  ** Idris has shorter type signatures where certain parameters can be elided
  ** Agda has very nice syntax for equality proofs

  ----------------------------------------------------------------
  I take a snapshop of the directory for sending a bug report later.  
    ../SeqDecProb_2013-10-25_record_bug.tgz

  Bug in Agda version 2.3.2:
    An internal error has occurred. Please report this as a bug.
    Location of the error: src/full/Agda/TypeChecking/Records.hs:216
  To reproduce:
    Load the file BackwardsInduction.agda
  Script version:
    tar -zxf SeqDecProb_2013-10-25_record_bug.tgz
    cd SeqDecProb
    agda -i ~/lib/agda-stdlib -i . BackwardsInduction.agda



2013-10-25: Continuing the development

  Step 1: Identify the current state and dependencies

Five working modules in dependency order:
* Prelude: [OK] (minimal)
* Context: [OK]
* OptimalControls: Prelude, Context [OK]
* OptimalPolicies: Prelude, Context, OptimalControls [OK]
* BackwardsInduction: Prelude, Context, OptimalPolicies [OK]

One module with unconverted Idris-code:
* Controls: TODO: convert from Idris

  Step 2: Short summary of the modules

Prelude: useful definitions collected + some Idris terminology
* Nat, Unit, Product, PropositionalEquality and Type = Set

Context: collects the assumptions used in the rest of the development
* record Max A Reward ... -- for types we can find the maximum of a function from A to Reward
* record RewProp -- properties for the Reward type (think: real numbers)
* record Context -- parametrised record collecting requirements for backwards induction
** TODO: use the Max record in Context (not important) 

OptimalControls: 
* XV t n -- subset of viable X
* CtrlSeq x n --  a control path from x of length n
* viableLemma -- CtrlSeq x n -> viable n x
* val ~: CtrlSeq x n -> carrier
* OptCtrlSeq -- defines optimality of control sequences

OptimalPolicies:
* Policy t n is a function from X that generates a "viable" y
* PolicySeq t n -- a sequence of policies for n steps from t
* ctrls ~: PolicySeq t n -> CtrlSeq x n
* Val   ~: PolicySeq t n -> carrier
* OptPolicySeq -- the concept of optimality for PolicySeq
* OptLemma: ***TODO: define this based on the time-independent case

BackwardsInduction:
* OptExtension: a relation stating when a PolicySeq can be extended by a certain Policy
* valY: the value of a step + the rest of a PolicySeq
* optExtension: calculates an optimal Policy to extend a PolicySeq with. ***TODO: complete definition
* OptExtensionLemma: proces that optExtension really does what it should. ***TODO: complete proof
* Bellman: the step case in the proof of backwards induction
* backwardsInduction: recursively build a PolicySeq
* BackwardsInductionLemma: correctness of backwardsInduction

----------------
